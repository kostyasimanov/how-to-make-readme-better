## A fully functional guide EXAMPLE how to write README on github

![github](https://www.greycampus.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/Project%20Documentation%20Does%20a%20project%20really%20need%20it.jpg)

This project is a description and currently include files just for me in the future to look back and see what i can make better.
Best practice is make a title with name of project and subtitle with information what that do. Then intro paragraph just like this.
In paragraph can add some list of short thing, how this project can help or what it can do, explain what this project making for and what include:

* numbered lists
* unnumbered lists
* links
* images
* tables
* codeblocks
* different size headers
* quotes
* it helps to make clean README
* make understanding of markdown
* when and what is most important in README


At this place here is more technical information, but first it would be good to have some visual - diagram or some other graphics, maybe youtube video that explains.
